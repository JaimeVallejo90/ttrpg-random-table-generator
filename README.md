Build TTRPG/DnD random tables with exact odds in the browser.

Features
- Exact probabilities: live chart, per-total table, EV, and range.
- Outcome ranges: lock/unlock, auto-spread, overlap/uncovered warnings.
- Keep/drop rules: drop/keep highest or lowest with adjustable count.
- Share/persist: permalink via “Share link”, state saved locally, works offline after first load.
- Copy-friendly: one-click copy of the outcome table.
- Light/dark theme.

How to use
1) Add dice (click die buttons; click a pill to remove).  
2) Choose a keep/drop rule and count.  
3) Set ranges or hit “Auto spread”; lock anything you don’t want moved.  
4) Copy outcomes or grab the share link.
